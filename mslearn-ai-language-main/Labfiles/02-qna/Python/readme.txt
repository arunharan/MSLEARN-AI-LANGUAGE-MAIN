Question:
what is a learning path?
Learning paths are collections of training modules that are organized around specific roles (like developer, architect, or system admin) or technologies (like Azure Web Apps, Power BI, or Xamarin.Forms). When you finish a learning path, you've gained a new understanding of different aspects of the technology or role you're studying. You also get an achievement trophy!
